Revision history for Perl extension Text::GenderFromName.

0.2  Fri Oct 26 18:01:18 2001
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.21 with options
		-X -n Text::GenderFromName
# Version 0.2.  Module list status is "Rdpf."
#
# Two big changes between this and version 0.1:
#
# First, the gender() subroutine now returns "m" if none of the rules 
# trigger, instead of "undef".  This isn't meant to be sexist, but merely 
# to reflect that the original rules were organized such that male names
# were meant to "fall through" to the end.
# 
# Second, I've appended a big list of names that gets searched first.
# This is counter to the spirit of the original code -- the whole point
# was that it used heuristics to guess at the gender rather than a 
# huge list of names.  But enough people have requested this that I 
# decided to add in the huge list, disk space be darned.
