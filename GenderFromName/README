CHANGES

Version 0.30 is a significant departure from previous versions. By
default, version 0.30 uses the U.S. Social Security Administration's
"Most Popular Names of the 1980's" list of 1001 male first names and
1013 female first names. See CAVEATS in the pod documentation for
details on this list.

Version 0.30 also allows for arbitrary female and male hashed lists to
be provided at run-time, and includes several built-ins to provide
matches based on exclusivity, weight, metaphones, and both version
0.20 and version 0.10 regexp-style matching. The user can also specify
additional match subroutines and change the match order at run-time.
